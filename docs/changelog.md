# Changelog — Bootstrap Protocol implementation

## 1.9.0 → 2.0.0 (Milestone A — doc-conformant; `gate_substrate` stays `"shell"`)

**Spec:** `.claude/specs/bootstrap-v2/requirements.md` rev-3 (owner-confirmed
2026-07-17). Milestone A implements R-0..R-6 (IC-1, IC-2, IC-3, IC-4, IC-7 +
the version identity and the model-remap assertion). The SDK substrate
(IC-5), native worktree routing (IC-6), and the IC gate ship as protocol
**2.1.0** in Milestone B [SR-04] — never under 2.0.0.

### R-0 — Version identity

- `PROTOCOL_VERSION` → `"2.0.0"` (`lib/installer.py`, `lib/templates.py`).
  `RETROFIT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` stays `"1.6.2"` (retrofit track untouched).
- Cross-references to the renamed protocol documents updated across `lib/`,
  `bin/`, `plugin/`, `tests/`, `README.md`
  (`BOOTSTRAP.md` → `Bootstrap-Protocol-v2-0-0.md`,
  `BOOTSTRAP-COMPANION.md` → `Bootstrap-Protocol-Companion-v2-0-0.md`).
  The v2.0.0 document's own convention is versioned self-naming (its
  line-149 naming rule), and its section anchors (6.D, Phases 9.5/9.7)
  survive, so emitted citations stay accurate.
- **Deliberately NOT updated:** the frozen RETROFIT-track documents
  (`RETROFIT.md`, `RETROFIT-COMPANION.md`, `RETROFIT-GAP-ANALYSIS.md`)
  still cite `BOOTSTRAP.md`; those references now dangle and are left for
  the retrofit track to reconcile (its docs are frozen at v1.6.2).
- `plugin/plugin.json` description bumped to v2.0.0;
  `tests/test_retrofit.py` literal version assertion 1.9.0 → 2.0.0.

**FREEZE-EXCEPTION (golden re-baseline #1).** Both fixtures re-baselined
for exactly two byte classes, verified by a HEAD-vs-worktree plan diff
with zero non-pairing residue:
1. `settings.json` `_generatedBy`: `protocol 1.9.0` → `protocol 2.0.0`;
2. protocol-document citations inside emitted hook/wrapper/config bodies:
   `BOOTSTRAP.md` → `Bootstrap-Protocol-v2-0-0.md`.
(default: 12 files; full_autonomous: 21 files.) Note: the spec's
task-decomposition guidance omitted R-0 from the re-baseline list, but
AC-A0-3's `_generatedBy` requirement necessarily perturbs the golden
surface — recorded here rather than silently absorbed.

### R-1 (IC-3) — `gate_substrate` state field

- `_write_state` emits `"gate_substrate": "shell"`.
- Non-destructive migration: a state file lacking the field (pre-2.0.0) is
  backed up once to `.bootstrap-state.json.pre-2.0.0` (Companion Migration
  notes) before being stamped; pre-existing keys are preserved.
- `"sdk-callable"` is unwritable in Milestone A (source-level tripwire in
  `tests/test_gate_substrate.py`; Milestone B replaces it with the
  `lib/ic_checks.py` gate). Outside the golden surface [SR-07].

### R-2 (IC-1) — `synthesize --validate-only`

- New flag on the `synthesize` subparser: parse interview → `resolve_config`
  invariants → violations to stderr → **no file written** → exit 0/2.
- The no-flag path is byte-identical to 1.9.0, proven against the HEAD code
  and locked as a mini-golden digest in `tests/test_validate_only.py`
  (AC-2-3 [SR-12]). This closes seam IG-01 (the §3.2 row upgrades when the
  seam re-pins to 2.0.0).

### R-3 (IC-4) — advisor default model

- `lib/llm_advisor.py` default: retired dated Sonnet-4 ID →
  **`claude-sonnet-5`** (verified 2026-07-17 against the live
  platform.claude.com models overview: it is the current Sonnet's Claude
  API ID *and* alias, a dateless pinned snapshot; no date suffix exists or
  may be appended). `BOOTSTRAP_INTERVIEW_LLM_MODEL` override retained.
- Proposes-never-decides and loud deterministic fallback proven unchanged
  (`tests/test_advisor_model.py`), including the never-send-commands
  invariant.

### R-4 (IC-2) — root-sentinel dual-honor (PERMANENT)

- `loop.sh`, `goal-loop.sh`, `auto.sh` additionally honor
  `<project>/.halt` (graceful stop at the next boundary) and NEW
  `<project>/.halt-hard` (immediate wrapper exit; the wrapper never signals
  an in-flight `claude -p` — killing processes is the caller's job).
  Legacy `.claude/queue/.halt`/`.resume` remain honored. Emitted comments
  bind the operator-completed iteration loops to re-check both sentinels
  at every iteration boundary. In `auto.sh` the checks run before the
  cleanup trap is installed so a halt refusal can never touch another
  run's `.run-active` sentinel.
- **Gitignore home [SR-17] — owner decision (a):** the installer manages a
  marker-delimited block (`# --- bootstrap-protocol managed: begin/end ---`)
  in the **project-root** `.gitignore` ignoring `/.halt` and `/.halt-hard`
  — a deliberate write surface outside `.claude/`, emitted as a visible
  plan action (kind `gitignore_root`, shown in `--dry-run` / Phase 0.5
  preview) only when at least one autonomous wrapper is emitted.
  Merge semantics: file absent → created (wholly-authored, digest-tracked
  normally); operator file → block appended once / refreshed in place,
  bytes outside the markers never touched, manifest entry
  `state: managed-block-appended` with a `block_digest` and **no**
  whole-file digest (operator edits outside the block never fire hand-edit
  warnings; uninstall keeps the co-owned file); torn block → loud SKIP.

**FREEZE-EXCEPTION (golden re-baseline #2, full_autonomous only).**
1. Three wrapper bodies gain the ROOT_HALT/ROOT_HALT_HARD guards;
2. One **added** action: project-root `.gitignore` (65 → 66 actions).
The default fixture is untouched by R-4 (its digest is the R-0 value).

### R-5 (IC-7) — machine-readable hook tiers

- Every manifest entry (and the `settings.json` entry) now carries
  `tier: security-critical | autonomy-critical | non-critical` per seam
  §7.2. Membership (contract-level; a change is a seam event):
  security-critical = secrets-gate, spec-gate-commit, dependency-gate,
  test-gate, eval-gate, tdd-gate, format-lint-gate, settings.json;
  autonomy-critical = drift-detector-loop-cooperation,
  iteration-summary-enforcement; all else non-critical;
  **spec-gate-entry deliberately non-critical** (warn-tier).
- Shell-era baseline, not a frozen ceiling: Milestone B adds
  `sdk_gates/gates.py` to the security set under the seam MAJOR [SR-02].
- No golden impact — the manifest is an `apply()`-time artifact [SR-07].

### R-6 — model remap: assertion, not assumed diff [SR-08]

- Asserted (not re-emitted): implementer `sonnet`, reviewer `opus`
  (+ `effort: high`), integrator explicitly `inherit`, goal judge
  `haiku`, no Fable subagent anywhere. Subagent frontmatter had **zero
  emission diff**, as the spec predicted — alias resolution is
  platform-side managed drift per the Companion guardrail.
- **AC-6-5 (docs verification, owner-reworded):** `effort:` IS a
  documented subagent-frontmatter key (code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents,
  verified 2026-07-17: overrides the session effort level; values
  low|medium|high|xhigh|max). The already-emitted `effort: high` on the
  reviewer (greenfield `templates.py` and the retrofit variant) is kept
  and now assertion-locked; greenfield/retrofit consistency asserted.

**FREEZE-EXCEPTION (golden re-baseline #3, full_autonomous only,
AC-6-4 only-if-diff case).** Exactly one file: `auto-config.md` gains the
Companion-mandated queue-summary-synthesis surface
(`summary_synthesis_enabled: true`, `summary_synthesis_model: haiku` —
Model Assignment Strategy table names `.claude/auto-config.md` as its
configuration surface; the 1.9.0 template omitted it).

### Finding 1 (PR #5 review) — goal-config keys vs Phase 9.6 (code moves)

Owner ruling: the discrepancy is code-vs-normative-spec — Phase 9.6
enumerates the goal-config surface with `evaluator_model` in the
`evaluator_*` family (Bootstrap-Protocol-v2-0-0.md:1336, :1382). Sweep of
the emitted `goal-config.md` against the full normative list:

| Phase 9.6 item | 1.9.0/2.0.0-A emission | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `max_iterations` (10) | ✓ present, correct | none |
| `evaluator_model` (haiku) | ✗ MISNAMED `judge_model` (value correct) | renamed; alias dual-read added |
| `evaluator_disagreement_threshold` (3) | ✗ MISSING (zero hits) | added |
| `evaluator_feedback_history_depth` (2) | ✗ MISSING (zero hits) | added |
| judge-API-failure retry posture (retry-once-then-halt) | ✗ missing; **doc names no config key** | documented in emitted comments; key naming needs an owner/spec decision. NOT to be conflated with `infra_retry_seconds`/`infra_max_consecutive_failures`: those configure the transient-`claude -p` infrastructure side (mirrored from `loop-config.md`, a mode with no judge at all); the judge-API posture is a distinct fixed retry-once-then-halt behavior ("same posture as" ≠ same keys, Phase 9.6) with genuinely no key in the emission |
| completion-criteria checklist | partial (`require_completion_sentinel: true`); no normative key names for the full checklist | kept; documented; naming needs spec decision |
| classifier thresholds | partial (`summary_failure_halt_threshold: 3` — the malformed-summary threshold); others unnamed in doc | kept; documented |
| audio-cue overrides | ✗ missing; no key names in doc | documented; naming needs spec decision |

Extras retained (not in the enumeration, protocol-consistent):
`infra_retry_seconds`, `infra_max_consecutive_failures` (transient
`claude -p` posture, mirrors loop-config), `investigate_disagreement`
(the Phase 9.6 `--investigate-disagreement` opt-in). `judge_model` was
the ONLY misnamed key found — no other aliases needed.

**Deprecated alias:** `goal-loop.sh` resolves `evaluator_model` from
`goal-config.md`; `judge_model` is honoured only when `evaluator_model`
is absent, with a loud stderr warning and a `hooks.log` entry. Exported
as `EVALUATOR_MODEL` for the operator-completed judge call.

**FREEZE-EXCEPTION (golden re-baseline #4, full_autonomous only).**
Exactly two files: `goal-config.md` (rename + two added keys +
documentation comments) and `goal-loop.sh` (alias resolution block).
`loop.sh` verified byte-identical. Tests:
`tests/test_goal_evaluator_keys.py` (13 checks).

**Migration note:** operators with a pre-2.0.0 `goal-config.md` keep a
working setup — the `judge_model` alias is honoured with a deprecation
warning until they rename the key; new emissions use `evaluator_model`.

### Finding 2 (PR #5 review) — `auto.sh` `.run-active` race safety (fixed)

Classified as a pre-existing conformance defect against Phase 9.7's
race-safety ("abort ... rather than overwriting",
Bootstrap-Protocol-v2-0-0.md:1455): the refuse-to-start path's EXIT trap
ran `rm -f "$RUN"` unguarded, deleting the *winner's* sentinel — which
would let a third invocation start a concurrent runner past the
combined-concurrency cap. Fixed in `auto.sh`:

1. **CLAIMED guard** exactly as the per-task wrappers: cleanup removes
   the sentinel only if this process claimed it.
2. **PID-liveness startup check** (Phase 9.7: "sentinel-presence alone is
   not a sufficient check"): `kill -0` plus a `/proc` fallback (so EPERM
   on another user's live process is not misread as dead). Unparseable
   sentinel → fail-safe refusal, untouched.
3. **Stale sentinel** (recorded PID dead): alert with the recorded start
   timestamp and ask before clearing; EOF/non-interactive defaults to No
   (side-effect-free refusal). Cleared-and-continue is logged.
4. **Re-verify before clear**: if the sentinel changed while waiting at
   the prompt, another runner claimed it — abort without touching it.
5. **O_CREAT|O_EXCL claim** (`set -C`), per the Phase 9.7 idiom the
   per-task wrappers already used; a failed claim aborts non-zero.

**FREEZE-EXCEPTION (golden re-baseline #5, full_autonomous only).**
Exactly one file: `auto.sh`. Tests: `tests/test_auto_run_sentinel.py`
(16 checks — live-PID refusal intact-sentinel, stale-cleared path,
race-loser intact-sentinel, normal-run self-cleanup, plus fail-safe
branches).

**Migration note:** `auto.sh` refusal is now **side-effect-free** — a
refusing invocation never deletes another run's `.run-active`.
Previously any existing sentinel caused refusal; now a live-PID sentinel
refuses, a stale one offers an operator-confirmed clear (non-interactive
invocations still refuse), so unattended behavior is unchanged except
that refusals no longer corrupt state.

### Migration note (operators)

Operators who never opt into the SDK substrate see **no behavioral change**
beyond: (1) the new `gate_substrate: "shell"` field (plus a one-time
`.bootstrap-state.json.pre-2.0.0` backup when upgrading a 1.x state file);
(2) the three autonomous wrappers additionally honoring the root sentinels
(inert unless you create `/.halt` or `/.halt-hard`); (3) for
autonomous-mode installs only, the managed root-`.gitignore` block keeping
those sentinels uncommittable. The shell gate suite is unchanged and
remains fully operative; fail-loud-on-empty-commands holds.

### PR5-04 hardening (adversarial review of PR #5)

Two hardening items on the Finding-2 startup sequence, verified against
the review's assertions (trap ordering was confirmed already correct —
`CLAIMED=0` precedes `trap cleanup EXIT`):

1. **Portable liveness probe:** `kill -0` + `/proc` fallback replaced by
   `ps -p` — immune to the EPERM misclassification (a live process under
   another user) and free of the Linux-only `/proc` dependence; a
   cannot-determine result still lands on refuse.
2. **tty-guarded prompt:** the stale-clear question is asked only when
   stdin is a terminal; a non-tty invocation auto-answers No *before any
   stdin read*, so an inherited open-but-silent pipe can never hang the
   runner (the F-2 hang class). `BOOTSTRAP_TEST_FORCE_PROMPT=1` is a
   documented TEST-ONLY override that forces the prompt path on a
   non-tty — it can only enable *asking* (the answer is still read from
   stdin, default No), never clearing.

**FREEZE-EXCEPTION (golden re-baseline no. 6, full_autonomous only).**
Exactly one file: `auto.sh`. Tests: `tests/test_auto_run_sentinel.py`
grows to 19 checks (adds the ps-p/tty-guard statics and the
non-tty-'y'-without-override case).

Also in this change: `plugin/plugin.json` bumps its own `version` field
`1.0.0` → `2.0.0` (the plugin is a distribution surface; its description
already declared protocol v2.0.0 — reviewer item PR5-05).

### Adversarial code review of the branch — fixes (four classes)

**Class 1 — `auto.sh` startup race safety & portability** (review findings
1, 4, 5, 6; all empirically reproduced by the verifiers before fixing):

1. **Dual-'y' race closed with a startup lock.** The whole
   check → operator-confirmed clear → O_CREAT|O_EXCL claim sequence now
   runs under `flock` on `queue/.run-active.lock`; a second invocation
   refuses instantly instead of racing the clear (previously two
   interactive operators could both pass re-verify and the loser's `rm`
   deleted the winner's fresh sentinel — reproduced). flock was already a
   hard requirement of the per-task wrappers; `auto.sh` now shares that
   posture (refuses if flock is unavailable). The re-verify stays as
   defense-in-depth against non-`auto.sh` sentinel writers. The lock file
   joins both gitignore fragments.
2. **Errexit-proof sentinel parsing.** `run_pid`/`run_start` helpers
   swallow sed failures (`|| true` inside the pipeline), so an unreadable
   sentinel or sentinel-as-directory reaches the loud fail-safe branches
   instead of dying silently via `set -euo pipefail` (previously rc 2/4
   with no message and a wrong infrastructure-failure exit reason).
3. **Three-state liveness.** `pid_alive` self-probes `ps -p $$` first; on
   platforms whose ps lacks `-p` (verified on BusyBox v1.37.0) it falls
   back to `kill -0`, whose success proves aliveness and whose failure is
   **cannot-determine → refuse** — never "dead". A live run's sentinel can
   no longer be offered for clearing on busybox-class systems.
4. **Prompt read time-bounded** (`read -t`, `BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT_TIMEOUT`
   default 60s): even a forced prompt on an open-but-silent pipe (the
   `BOOTSTRAP_TEST_FORCE_PROMPT` leak scenario, reproduced as an
   indefinite hang) now falls through to No at the bound.

**FREEZE-EXCEPTION (golden re-baseline no. 7, full_autonomous only).**
`auto.sh` + the queue-gated gitignore fragment line. Tests:
`tests/test_auto_run_sentinel.py` grows to 26 checks (dual-invocation
lock refusal, directory sentinel, broken-ps dead/live cases, hang bound).

**Class 2 — state-file migration & retrofit parity** (review findings 3,
10; plus the double-read TOCTOU noted by the verifiers):

1. **Corrupt-state backup.** The IC-3 migration now reads the pre-2.0.0
   state file ONCE and backs up those raw bytes even when the file is too
   corrupt to parse — previously a truncated state file skipped the
   backup and was clobbered (verifier-reproduced data loss). The
   single-read design also removes the parse-vs-backup second-read
   window, so the `.pre-2.0.0` backup is byte-identical to what the
   migration classified.
2. **Retrofit `gate_substrate` parity.** `_write_retrofit_state` now
   emits `gate_substrate: "shell"` alongside `bootstrap_protocol_version`
   — retrofit installs ship the same 2.0.0 wrappers and shell gate suite,
   and the 2.1.0 `ic_checks`/seam consumers key off the field.
   (Additive top-level key; B5 shape and the C1 sibling-function
   discipline preserved — `_write_state` untouched by this half.)

No golden impact (state files are `apply()`-time artifacts).
Tests: `tests/test_gate_substrate.py` → 15 checks (corrupt-file case);
`tests/test_retrofit.py` → 254 (8.5 parity assertion).

**Class 3 — gitignore surfaces** (review findings 2, 7, 8):

1. **Retrofit root-`.gitignore` emission.** `_apply_retrofit_overlay` (the
   single retrofit dispatch site per C1) now appends the `gitignore_root`
   managed-block action whenever any autonomous opt-in scaffolds a
   wrapper — the greenfield gate reads top-level `*_enabled` flags, which
   B5 pins false in retrofit mode, so retrofit projects previously got
   root-sentinel-honoring wrappers with committable sentinels (AC-4-5
   violated on that path; verifier-reproduced). No opt-ins → no root
   write, scope unchanged.
2. **Co-owned metadata preserved.** The managed-block append/refresh
   paths now keep the operator's existing file mode instead of resetting
   to 0644 (the inode still changes — content-write atomicity wins over
   inode stability for a gitignore).
3. **Migration backups never committable.** Both emitted `.claude/
   .gitignore` fragments gain the `.bootstrap-state.json.pre-*` pattern,
   covering the new `.pre-2.0.0` backup and every future one (the
   retrofit fragment's per-version entries stay for back-compat).

**FREEZE-EXCEPTION (golden re-baseline no. 8, BOTH fixtures, one file
each).** `.claude/.gitignore` gains the `pre-*` pattern — the first
default-fixture change since R-0; items 1 and 2 are overlay/apply-time,
outside the golden surface. Tests: `tests/test_root_sentinels.py` → 34
checks (retrofit emission + no-opt-in scope guard, mode preservation,
fragment pattern).

### Milestone B (reserved)

IC-5 (SDK `PreToolUse` callables per seam §9, Tessera-owned runner,
module-only emission), IC-6 (native worktree routing, flag/version to be
verified against official docs), `lib/ic_checks.py`, the runtime-floor
startup check (seam binds ≥ v2.1.210 for fail-closed PreToolUse timeout —
confirm the exact floor per the seam's own TODO), and the
`PROTOCOL_VERSION` → `"2.1.0"` bump land only after Milestone A review and
owner approval, and are recorded here as `2.0.0 → 2.1.0` when they do.
